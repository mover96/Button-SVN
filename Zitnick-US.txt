1. As a user, I want to be able to purchase new backgrounds to press my button on so that I can experience new button-pressing environments.
2. As a user, I want to see where I am on a leaderboard, so I can see how often my competition are pressing their buttons.
3. As a user, I want to share my button on Facebook so I can brag to my friends about my cool button skins.
